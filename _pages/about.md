My research centers on operational strategies for effectively managing an organization's limited resources in meeting its objectives. Applications that I am interested in are revenue management and pricing, inventory management, and supply chain management. I address many such questions in the retailing domain, but I also address these questions in other sectors such as non-profits. I have worked with several major U.S. retailers on these topics, including Target, Best Buy, Kohl's, Office Depot, and Staples.

One of my research interests is on decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, a research question that I ask is: How a firm can utilize its data in order to make data-driven decisions that are provably near-optimal? Or if data is not available, can a firm make decisions that are robust to some distributional ambiguity? 

Another research interest is on studying new operations management problems inspired by the "new world of retail".  In recent years, the retail industry has seen significant innovations in the systems that support smoother product flow (e.g., omni-channel fulfillment, "return centers"), as well as the technologies that influence customer demand (e.g., social media, online platforms). In my research, I develop new analyses and optimization techniques for operations problems with these newly emerged dynamics of demand and supply.
